This is a placeholder file in the GitHub repository: 

https://github.com/proctor-ucsf/trachoma-sero-transmission

The first script in the analysis (1-make-datasets.Rmd) will download publicly available data from the Open Science Framework and will store it here (in data).  

The original datasets are located on OSF: https://osf.io/ykjc4/

The downloaded datasets are named:

trachoma_serology_public_data_indiv_v2.rds   (individual level file)  
trachoma_serology_public_data_cluster_v2.rds (cluster level file)

From these files, the first script will then create the analysis datasets that are used in all analyses for this paper. 

Those files are named:

trachoma_sero_transmission_analysis_indiv.csv   / .rds (individual level file)
trachoma_sero_transmission_analysis_cluster.csv / .rds (cluster level file)
trachoma_sero_transmission_analysis_study.csv   / .rds (study level file)

These three files have been included as Source Data in the Nature Communications article: Tedijanto et al. 2023 Measuring transmission intensity of trachoma with serology. They are further stored on OSF in the paper's repository: https://osf.io/uarx6/
